Problem Resolution: 'mc' Command Not Found in Jenkins Pipeline

Follow these steps to properly install and configure the 'mc' command in a Jenkins container:

1. Access Jenkins Container:
   Use this command to enter the Jenkins container in interactive mode:
   docker exec -ti jenkins_container /bin/bash

2. Update Package List:
   Before installing new packages, ensure that the list of available packages is up to date:
   apt-get update

3. Install Wget:
   Wget is used for downloading files from the internet. Install it using the following command:
   apt-get install wget

4. Download 'mc' Client:
   Use Wget to download the latest version of the 'mc' client for Linux:
   wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc

5. Make the File Executable:
   Change the permissions of the downloaded file to make it executable:
   chmod +x mc

6. Move 'mc' to Binary Directory:
   To make the 'mc' command globally accessible, move it to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:
   mv mc /usr/local/bin

After following these steps, the 'mc' command should be available in your Jenkins pipeline.
